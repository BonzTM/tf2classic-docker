05, Jul, 2020
Prerequisites

    TF2 Classic
    A Linux server running Ubuntu
    A SFTP/SSH client
    Basic knowledge how linux works

I will not go over how to connect to your server
Step 1: Installing the sdk2013 server

    Move the TF2 Classic .7z file where you want your server installed
    Download the steamcmd package by running sudo apt install steamCMD.
    Run steamcmd and after its done run login anonymous in steamcmd.
    Run force_install_dir insert_full_path_here in steamCMD to select the directory the server install into.
    After you did that run app_update 244310 validate in steamCMD.
    Type exit to get out of steamCMD.

Step 2: Moving files

    Install p7zip by running sudo apt install p7zip-full.
    Run 7z x insert_tf2_classic_name_here.7z to extract the folder.
    Run mv tf2classic insert_full_path_to_server_directory_here to move the folder to your server`

Step 3: Configuration
All steps will be executed in the tf2classic folder, cd tf2classic.

    Generate config(s) on cfg.tf.
    Move them into the tf2classic/cfg folder.

Step 4: Running the server
All steps will be executed in the server folder.

    Use any text editor of your choice to create runserver.sh, like nano, nano runserver.sh.
    Input ./srcds_run -console -game tf2classic +map pl_upward +maxplayers 24 (this is a example).
    Exit out of nano by pressing strg (ctrl) + x.
    run chmod +x runserver.sh

Step 5: Create a user

    Run createuser username_here to create a user.
    Run visudo to open the root file.
    Insert username_here ALL=(ALL:ALL)ALL.
    Exit out of nano by pressing strg (ctrl) + x.

Step 6: Running the server

    Change the user by running su - username_here.
    Run cd full_path_to_server to go to the server folder again.
    Run ./runserver.sh to run the server.`

Issues:

    I cant connect, what do i do?
    your firewall probaly blocks the port, run ufw allow 27015, to unblock it.
